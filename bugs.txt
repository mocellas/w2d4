Fixed
Bug01_Major: The main app functionality - the /u/:shortURL route - isn't working. This is happening because you've changed the structure of urlDatabase to include userID, but forgot to change how this route looks for the data. Hint: it's now in urlDatabase[req.params.shortURL].URL (line 205 in server.js). OK
Bug05_Medium: Whenever a new url is submitted in app.post("/urls") you should redirect to /urls, not show Ok on the screen. 


Open
Bug02_Major: Pressing the "delete" button close to an url goes to the edit page instead. ?

Bug03_Major: In the edit page, the long url is being shown as [object Object]. This means you're trying to display a whole object insted of its contents. Hint: again, you should look for urls[shortURL].URL, since you've changed the object (line 9 of urls_show.ejs). ?

Bug04_Major: There are several lines of code that don't really do anything. Two examples: bcrypt.compareSync("req.body.username", hashed_password); // returns true bcrypt.compareSync("req.body.password", hashed_password); // returns false You're saying these lines return a value, but you're not storing that value anywhere. If you don't need these values, there's no point in calling these functions, so these lines shouldn't be there. Also: you're trying to compare the string "req.body.username" instead of the value req.body.username which would contain whatever comes from the form. ?

Bug07_Minor: This is related to code cleanup. Whenever you submit code, make sure to have merged the latest working version to master. It isn't good practice to submit feature branches. ?



In-Progress
Bug06_Medium: The code needs to be better organized. There are plenty of conflicting comments, routes that aren't being used and functions being defined in between routes. Your code should be legible and presentable, so make sure to clean it up before submitting. Javascript isn't partitularly easy to read, so you need to make it easier for you. A good way to organize your server.js file would be: Partially OK
1. All requires
2. Application setup (constant and global variable definitions, app.set(), app.use() and so on)
3. Function definitions
4. Routes (app.get(), app.post(), ...)
5. app.listen() call
